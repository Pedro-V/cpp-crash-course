# C++ Crash Course

Notes on the book.

On this tree, features are defined in the following way:

- `c`: C specific. Compiles with C compilers, doesn't with C++ ones.
- `same`: Compiles with both C++ and C compilers, same implementation.
- `diff`: Compiles with both C++ and C compilers, but different implementation
  (generated code) by main compilers
- `c++`: C++ specific. Compiles with C++ compilers, doesn't with C ones.

Unnanotated features are assumed to be `c++`.
